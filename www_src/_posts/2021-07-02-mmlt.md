[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12501){:target="_blank"} 
introduces novel multivariate conditional transformation models, where the
marginal distributions can be understood as univariate transformation
models. The joint distribution is characterised by a gaussian copula, which
also allows covariate-dependent correlations to be modelled.

Some forms of these models can be estimated by the mmlt() function in
package [tram](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram){:target="_blank"}.
